The Quiz Application is designed to provide an engaging and interactive user experience for testing knowledge across various topics. The development process followed a modular and user-centric approach, broken down into the following key stages:

1. üéØ Planning & Requirements
Defined core features: multiple-choice questions, score tracking, timer-based challenge.

Identified target users: students, educators, and casual users.

Chose stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no external frameworks for simplicity).

2. üß© UI/UX Design
Built a clean and responsive layout using flexbox/grid and modern typography.

Incorporated a header with profile icon and a minimal footer for branding.

Added animations (fade, scale) to enhance visual engagement.
